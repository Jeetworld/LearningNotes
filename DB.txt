The files containing the relevant test cases are SavingsTest, LoanTest, CheckingTest (they may ignore the other files with test cases)

validate the existing test cases (are assertions missing? )

add addional, missing test cases (e. g. checking account has only 2)

add edge cases (hope it is clear what that means for the provided example)

Associate  has to implement the test case at initial level with good Functional flow  and if we run it against our reference implementation it should work (this would be a TDD approach)
