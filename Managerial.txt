----------------------
I'm leading team of 3 memebers in current project 


QWhat are some of the workplace successes that make you proud?
AI got many client appreciations for my quick work and for my efforts

Q--How to resolve workplace conflicts
A--“I believe it is essential to resolve all conflicts with coworkers as soon as possible without involving the upper management or other individuals. Conflicts become harder to resolve if they persist for long periods. However, most conflicts occur because of miscommunication, so I schedule a meeting with the relevant individuals and allow everyone to express their views. This allows us to resolve the conflict effectively.”

QWhat motivates you at work?
A“I am motivated by the desire to help guide all of my team members to success. For example, I remember when I was helping one of my team members complete a new task. I provided them with examples of similar tasks I completed in the past and some helpful tips. They ended up receiving praise for this task and it fulfilled me knowing I helped them accomplish success."

Q--What was the best catch you ever made?
A-- Many time, i got client approeceations for my good work. 
1 incident in this current compay: it was my first day of KT. my senior gave me kt of the application and hand over me to hands on the application. On that first day, I found i very good bug in theri application which was missed by our whole team QA. Than they appreciate me on the very first day
2 Incident from my personal life: My father in law is Bank Manager and it;s govt bank. And he gave us 2023 calender in which i found typo mistake about "follow" spelling

QHow much time is enough time to test for a release?
A when we met the client req and every defect is in closed state and all the test results are positive (like no bug in regression testing and in UAT testing)

QWhat if you missed bug and end user detect it?
AFirst chill. Then you should focus on how quickly to resolved it. Then :

1)Root cause of the bug
	-try to replicate the bug in lower env or not
	-is there any kind of miscoummincation in the requirement or not

2) Than you should make sure it should not repeat next time and must add in regression suite or some checklist

3) Accept the mistake as you are part of the team if it's staright forward scenario.

Check what is your test coverage.
Try to achieve 100% test coverage(UT, FT, IT, UAT).
Try to have a better regression suite. If you already not have it , invest to build it.
If TC for that bug is not in TC or Regression suite, than add to it
If is is present in Regressions uite, than verify the evidence attached with TC

Also check whther it is replicating in prod only or in QA env also.


Also, in software world bugs do come. Accept it. Should always focus on how quickly to resolve it and not repeat it and in resolving one should not open another.


----------------------
why to siwtch from CHD to Siuth side
A/; I want to learn and want to work in new challenging env as I know chandigrah env is ttoally differnt than south side ennv. Why bec:
people are more prosfessional in south like in every aspect
more big projects are there


----------------------

*******what you do when yu find critical bug at the end of the sprint?
-Than i will discuss with PO or Team lead that is that a valid to fix in current sprint or not ?
If yes, than we consider this as hot fix and wait for the fix and than will test and quickly execute the regression.
If no, than we will move it to next sprint and fix in next sprint.


********Where you see yourself after 5 years 
-I am very passionate about test automation tools and technology like UiPath and I would love to automate the stuff which is getting repeated multiple times during our test cycles. I also create automation script to delete spams emails from gmail
-I would like to become best in my work in next 5 years.
-I would now like to take on managerial responsibilities. I want to become a leader with several teams working on different projects simultaneously and keeps on learning. Considering the number of projects your organisation runs, I believe I can work towards that aspiration."


********Hobbies : spendin time with family
lovinf dogs, 
cycling and every day to cover more and more area


Q--what is your goal (entire life)??: I would like to become best in my work and will be role model for my children.

Q--If one of your colleague is not working. then how will you encourage him??
A--Tips for helping and supporting colleagues at work

	 Communicate often: schedule meeting and unserdtand it's concern.
	Recognize their challenges
	Volunteer your time
	 Give advice
	Offer praise
***A performance improvement plan (PIP) is a document that aims to help employees who are not meeting job performance goals. 

Q--Why should I hire you??????
https://testertips.com/why-should-we-hire-you-as-a-software-tester-2/
Companies want to hire software testers that are passionate about testing, about finding faults in their software, and who bring constructive criticism for delivering great products.
-Passion for Software Testing
-Out of the Box Thinking
I also awareded with 2 champ award recemtly lastyear for Q4 awards in dxc for my performance
So I believe I'm suitable candidate for this role in your reputaed company...I will prove my self if you gave me a chance

Q--Bigest Achievement:
that got 2 champ awarads during one year

Q--what you do if you have very less time to perform testing
-However, in order to assess the priority, look at the risks and prioritize based on the requirements and their business impact and priorities. 

Q-- what is your improvement arrea
A-- Communication skills- which i keep on improving 

Q--What you think that tester should have qulity
A-- Out of Box thinking - to create TC
 	Exellent Communicaation Skills
	Quick and Continous learning(Technical Tools and Technical Knowlegde): learning new technologies which helps you in keeps you updated in market
	wise time mangement: plan before execution to save time 
	

Q--what is your contribution to the project with technical or process?
A-- I made enchancement in existing automation framework
	-By removing redundent code
	-By increase performance of the execution by cut down irrelevant waits 
	-By updating proper logging information
	2) By asking dev team to surrender APIS during UI development phase, so that we can find the bugs earlier at the early satage and as per the thumb rule, when we find the error at early stage, it save time/cost and efforts
	3)Earlier , we were using the screenshot process to store our evidence whiel executing TC BUT now we are using video recordings bu using ppt :)

Q--what you do from the starting if you are only one to implement the process
A-- https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/how-to-write-test-plan-document-software-testing-training-day3/

Q--what you do if there is bug leakage

Q--what you do if your team member missing imp bug/ Not working properly

Q--what is your latest critical/ good bug catches
A--Unathorised person can also have full access of the application or roles of admin by just tweak the url of the resource in browser. And this issue is occuring in most of our applications
2)

Q--what you do if developer rejects your bug
A-- Unseratnd their concern.
	-schedule a meeting and show them by these steps you can reproduce the bug
	-tell him this is the impact of this bug on application and on business flow
	-

Q--How would you start automation tetsing from start

Q--Daily testing activities

==================

Challenges:

>>When dev team lately surrender new build to QA team. Then we have very less time to test all the features + perform regression testing. - So then we will extend our working hours + prioritixxe the test cases as per the client req(or main functionality of the app whihc is using by client on daily basis) and execute them

>>When there is new req from the client that we need to implemet new things with new technology, than there is slightly challenging situation is there. Because we need to work on daily raotuine tasks + learn the new automation tool side by side.
EX:
learn AUTO IT to handle the windows based stuff
learn UIPath to handle desktop apps
migrate from log4j to logback 
upgrade from old selenium version to new version 4.6.0

>>We are migrating from old java aplications to new javascript application where we see lot of complex DOM to locate the elements like lot of ajax calls are there. 
overcomes: 
with diff strategies like
	ThreadSleep
	Implicit Wait
	Explicit Wait
	WebdriverWait
	Fluent Wait
Ajax Calls:
It will updates the part/s of a web page without reloading the whole page.

Overcomes:
By container = By.cssSelector(".container");
		wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 5);
		wait.until(ExpectedConditions.presenceOfElementLocated(container));
		wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOf(TextElement));

>>Testing phase is usually under a time constraint
>>Understanding the requirements can sometimes be a challenge
>>Lack of skilled testers
>>Frequent Requirements changing
>>Lack of tools, resource, and training

===================
Roles and Responsibilities

>>Analyzing and understanding business requirement in order to achieve the goals of testing
>>Developing, Maintaining and executing existing tests scripts/regression suites
>>Preparation of test scenarios/cases/execution and test results.

>>Implemented automation using Selenium WebDriver, JAVA, Selenium Grid, Cucumber, Maven

>>Attending Agile meetings (Daily scrum meeting/Sprint planning/Backlog refinement) on assigned projects
>>Attending the client calls and meetings

>>Providing results to project managers/developers/manual testers and stakeholders

>>Involved in knowledge transfer to the newly recruited personnel

------------------
Factors should keep in mind before automating anything from scratch:

>>UNDERSTAND THE REQ::  understand the req from client taht which flow need to be automated and what is the expectation of the client from this automation suite. who and how will use this framework(by jenkins or by cmd). It should be understandable by both techincal + non technical person

>>PRODUCT STABILITY:: is product stable or not? if stable than proceed further

>>KNOWLEFGE OF PRODUCT::  deep knwoldge of product which need to be automated. sometimes more than one way to do the task. so which is good and most reliable to automate.

>>BUILD TOOL:: need to follow proper build management tool, so that it can be understand and maninted by other people also like MAVEN follows some standards

>>CORRECT FRAMEWORK:: Correct framework according to the requirement. If it is for everyone, then BDD. 
Data Driven Automation Framework
Keyword Driven Automation Framework
Modular Automation Framework
Hybrid Automation Framework
Linear Scripting Framework
Behavior Driven Development Framework


>>GOOD DESIGN:: Reduce redunancy like following POM desing pattern

>>CHOOSE AUOMATIOMN TOOL ACC TO BUDGET:: which automation tool need to select acc to budget and req. like QTP, TOSCA is paid and selenium is open source

>>TEST DATA & CONFIGURATION SHOULD BE SEPARATE:: test data and configuration should always be seprate , so that it can be configure at run time

>>EASY INTEGRATION:: Easily integrate with thrid party tool

>>MAINTAINCE:: manintaince should be easy

>>REPORT:: Good reporting acc to the req. Some prefer: email report and some do not


Reports and Logs: Test automation framework should provide all the details required for test execution. Logs should be provided with necessary details of problem along with the custom message.

Scripts and Data Handling: Input test data should be kept separated from the Automated test scripts.

Library: Library should contain the external connections such as databases, application & generic functions as well as all the reusable components.

Scripting Standards: Maintain a coding standard across the test automation framework is necessary.

Well Organized Framework: An organized framework provide support for addition of new features and easy integration with automation tools and third party tools etc.

Configuration Options: Framework should provide an option to select the configurations at run time so that it can be used as per the test execution requirement.

Good Design: Test design should be such that the application locators are separated from the test code so that the locators can be updated independently in the locator file. Test data should be separated from the code and pulled from the excel, csv or xml file and data can be updated whenever required.

Framework Versioning: Various versions of framework should be maintained in a local repository which would further help in easy monitoring of the changes made to the software code.

Extensibility and Maintenance: An ideal test automation framework should withstand all new enhancements to the software application and allow modification of the existing features.

=======================================

TEST ESTIMATION(in Manual):

Estimating effort for the test is one of the major and important tasks in Test Management.

The following factors are taken into consideration to estimate:

1) Time: How much time testing will take
2) Cost Required
3) Team member(s) needed: Team Count
4) Skills required

Techniques:
1) Work Breakdown Structure: In WBS, a testing task gets broken down into smaller modules, and those modules are further divided into measurable sub-modules.

2) 3-Point Software Estimation:  Three-point estimation is based on statistical data
In the three-point estimation, three values are initially produced for every task based on previous experience. For example, to complete a specific task the different possibilities are

	Best case estimate: 120 man-hours or 15 days with experienced team members
	The most likely estimate: 170 hours or 21 days with enough resources and moderate team members experience
	The worst-case estimate: 200 man-hours or 25 days and with a team that has lesser work experience


3) Wideband Delphi Method
4) Use-Case Methodologies
5) Distribution in Percentage
6) Method of Ad-Hoc
7) Functional Point Analysis



TEST ESTIMATION(in Automation):


Before you begin with estimating any project, it is imperial to understand each and every phase that your project will be going through, so that you can give a correct and a justified estimation.
Factors:
1) Scrope of the project: Scope typically means identifying the correct test cases for automation.


2) Compleity of the Application
3) Use of Suporting tools/tecnologies
4) Implement the Framework
5) Learning & Training
6) Env setup
7) Coding/scripting and review


*****CHART:
take refernce of ss in onenote
Total efforst for each test case: 5 hrs * 4(test case) for very simple TC
Total efforst for each test case: 3 hrs * 3(test case) for  simple TC
Total efforst for each test case: 2 hrs * 4(test case) for  complex TC

===========================================

ROI(return on investment):
Calculating ROI on test automation is a measurement of how much QA time test automation saves.

ROI = Savings
	-------
	Investment

Saving = [Time to run a single manual test – time to run the same test in automation]x Number of test x Number of test runs.  

Investment = time required to build frameworks + maintenance cost + (time to code one tests X number of tests)
